 ### Notes
 Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
 The biggest challenge.. getting the GIFs to display properly here. I have pasted two different links, both work in hackermd, under 10MB, but I cannot get them to display in the readme file. I want to move on to the next assignment and will hopefully be able to fix this later when I submit that one. An actual link to it posted on imgur is: https://imgur.com/vFqh9DL
